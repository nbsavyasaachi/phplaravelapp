                                With this web application, the user can track the list of the items to be purchased segregated into different predefined categories. Add the amount spent on each item purchased and also the store from which it is being purchased.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Visualize the amount spent on each of the categories in graphs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The graphs are made using plotly.js library. 
                                <br/>
                                Deletion of categories will result in an error as they are associated with the tasks.
                                Trying to figure out a solution for it. Currently, hiding the delete button for the categories.
